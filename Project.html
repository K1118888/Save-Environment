                <h2>About Environment</h2>
            </center>
            <p>The environment refers to the natural world around us, including all living and non-living things. It
                encompasses the air we breathe, the water we drink, the land we live on, and the ecosystems that support
                life. The environment plays a vital role in sustaining life on Earth by providing essential resources
                such
                as: <br>

                <b>Air:</b> The atmosphere contains oxygen that humans and animals need to breathe and survive. <br>
                <b>Water:</b> Freshwater ecosystems like rivers, lakes, and groundwater sources provide clean water for
                drinking, agriculture, and other purposes. <br>
                <b>Land:</b> The soil supports agriculture, which produces food, while forests and other ecosystems
                provide
                habitats for wildlife. <br>
                <b>Biodiversity:</b> Diverse species of plants, animals, and microorganisms interact in ecosystems,
                contributing to the balance and health of the environment. <br><br>
            <h3><u>Importance of the Environment </u></h3>
            <b>(i) Human Health:</b> Clean air and water are essential for good health. Polluted environments lead to
            diseases and health problems. <br>
            <b>(ii) Sustaining Life:</b> Plants, animals, and other organisms rely on the environment to survive.
            Destruction of habitats can lead to extinction. <br>
            <b>(iii) Climate Regulation:</b> Forests, oceans, and other ecosystems help regulate the Earth's climate by
            absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. <br>
            <b>(iv) Resources for Development:</b> The environment provides natural resources like minerals, fossil
            fuels,
            and timber, which are crucial for human development and economies.</p>

           <center><h2>Causes of Environmental Damage</h2></center><br>
           <ol>
            <b><u><li style="font-size: larger; font-family:cursive ;">Pollution from industries and vehicles:</li></u></b>
            <p>Pollution from industrial activities and vehicles represents one of the most significant threats to environmental health. As economies grow and urban populations increase, the emissions and waste generated by these sources have severe consequences for air quality, public health, and ecosystems.</p>
            <b><u><li style="font-size: larger; font-family:cursive ;">Deforestation for agriculture and urbanization:</li></u></b>
            <p>Deforestation refers to the large-scale removal of trees from forested areas, transforming the land for alternative uses. Agriculture and urbanization are two of the primary drivers of deforestation, leading to significant environmental, economic, and social consequences.</p>
            <b><u><li style="font-size: larger; font-family:cursive ;">Overuse of natural resources:</li></u></b>
            <p>The overuse of natural resources refers to the unsustainable consumption of the Earth’s natural assets, including water, soil, minerals, forests, and fossil fuels. This phenomenon has significant implications for environmental health, economic stability, and social equity.</p>
            <b><u><li style="font-size: larger; font-family:cursive ;">Plastic waste and non-biodegradable materials:</li></u></b>
            <p>Plastic waste has emerged as one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. With the proliferation of plastic products in daily life, the accumulation of plastic waste poses significant threats to ecosystems, human health, and the economy. Non-biodegradable materials, which do not break down naturally, exacerbate these problems, creating long-lasting environmental challenges.</p>
            <b><u><li style="font-size: larger; font-family:cursive ;">Climate change and global warming:</li></u></b>
            <p>Climate change and global warming refer to the long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities. While climate change encompasses all changes in climate, global warming specifically refers to the increase in Earth’s average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere</p>
